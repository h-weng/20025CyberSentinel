# 2025 DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge Writeup

On June 14 at 11 a.m., the 2025 [DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge](https://www.correlation-one.com/dod-cyber-sentinel) officially began. As a first-time [Capture The Flag (CTF)](https://ctf101.org/) competitor, I adopted a step-by-step strategy: tackle easy problems first, then move on to more challenging ones.

#### Easy Challenges

I started with the easy problems because the free hints were clear and directly relevant. To analyze network captures, I used tcpdump; for web tasks, I fetched data with curl; and for binary analysis, I extracted text with strings. Solving each easy challenge taught me new techniques, expanded my tools, and prepared me for medium and hard challenges.

#### Medium Challenges

After completing the easy challenges, I moved on to medium-level challenges. I used two hints (25 points each), but they assumed a deeper cybersecurity background than I had, so they weren’t helpful. Instead, I relied on critical thinking and the same tools—packet analysis, HTTP requests, and manual inspection—to solve challenges, or at least try.

#### Hard Challenges

When I reached the hard challenges, I realized they were beyond my current skill set. Rather than guess, I didn't go any further.

#### Lessons Learned

- Starting with easy questions helped me learn more about CTF challenges and tools.
- Free hints in the easy category were valuable for understanding problem styles.
- Hints on medium challenges weren’t useful without cyber security expertise.
- Document as you go.  Clear, or any notes make for easy write ups.

Moving forward, I will continue refining my skill set in cyber security and a build a stronger foundation before my next CTF.
